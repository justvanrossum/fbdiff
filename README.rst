fbdiff
~~~~~~

`fbdiff` is a tool that reports a brief summary of table differences
in OpenType fonts. It reports which tables exist in only one of the
fonts, and it will report which common tables are different and which
are identical.

It only looks at the binary data: tables are not parsed.

Example usage:

.. code::

    $ fbdiff fontA.ttf fontB.ttf
    Tables only in font B:
      meta

    Different tables:
                A      B
      GPOS  29628  29574 bytes
      STAT     28    162 bytes
      fpgm   4095   4078 bytes
      glyf  36984  26626 bytes
      head     54     54 bytes
      loca    940    940 bytes
      name   3078   4557 bytes
      prep   1339   1339 bytes

    Identical tables:
      GDEF, GSUB, HVAR, OS/2, TSI0, TSI1, TSI2, TSI3, TSI5, TSIC, VDMX,
      avar, cmap, cvar, cvt , fvar, gasp, gvar, hhea, hmtx, maxp, post
